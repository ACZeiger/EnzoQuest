# Final Project: EnzoQuest
An implementation of 2D kinematic motion, developed by Bella Auker and Abigale Zeiger.

In this 2D platformer, take control of Enzo, a tuxedo cat who's ready to explore the world around and find some tasty cans of tuna before making his way back to his favorite box for a well-deserved nap.

### How to Play

- To move Enzo, use the left and right arrow keys, the A and D keys, or the left stick of your favorite gamepad.
- To make Enzo jump, use the spacebar or one of the face buttons on your favorite gamepad.
- The longer you hold the jump button, the higher Enzo with jump!
- Each time you collect a can of tuna, your score will increase. See how many you can find before returning Enzo to his beloved cardboard box.

## Project Report

### Reflection

Ultimately, this iteration, our biggest obstacle was communication. Between the holidays, other
other projects, and just life, it greatly effected our ability to come together and make a cohesive 
team and make genuine growth in our project. I hope to apply what we've learned from this iteration,
and its outcome, to our last iteration. When the communication barrier breaks it definitely takes
everything else with it, and we definitely got to see that first hand this iteration. 


### Self-Assessment

- [X] D-1: The repository contains a <code>README.md</code> file in its top-level directory on the default branch.
- [X] D-2: The project content is eligible for an <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings-guide/">ESRB Rating</a> of M or less.
- [X] C-1: Your repository is well-formed, in our course organization, with an appropriate <code>.gitignore</code> file, no unnecessary files tracked, a single mainline branch named <code>main</code> or <code>master</code>, and all commit messages following <a href="https://cbea.ms/git-commit/">our commit message style guide</a>.
- [X] C-2: Your release is tagged using <a href="https://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a> where the major version is zero, the minor version is the iteration number, the patch version is incremented as usual for each change made to the minor version, and the release name matches the release tag.
- [X] C-3: You have a clear legal right to use all incorporated assets, the licenses for all third-party assets are tracked in the <code>README.md</code> file, and you have satisfied all license requirements.
- [X] C-4: Either the <code>README.md</code> contains instructions for how to play the game or such instructions are incorporated into the game.
